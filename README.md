Finale assignment for data 4

our question: is freedom of choices influenced by civic participation (we could take in consideration a policy specific)? 
We will use the Database from WPJ on the quality of democracy over 140 countries worldwide for a time period that goes from 2012 until 2022. 
N = 140 / T = 10

The code will be done in R (Menta Mora) and STATA (Jacopo Binati)

Good morning
I am writing this email to propose a question for the final project which will be done by Menta Mora and me, Jacopo Binati together. The question we would like to analyse is if freedom of choices influeced by civic participation over different countries worldwide and from 2012 until 2022. In the case study we will take in consideration confounders such as Freedom of opinion and expression, freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy. Moreover we would like to see how, and if, Covid-19 influenced and changed the trend of countries over the years. 

                    ------------------------------------

In the first file, the database was cleaned of variables unrelated to the research. then they were renamed.
two variables 'after' and 'before' were generated for the years 2021 and 2015. the choice was made to understand whether the covid-19 period had an impact on civic participation. 
the variables 'treated' and 'untreated' were created for the years.

The regressions performed analyse the relationship between the average civic participation between 2015 and 2021 with the other confounders.
The second regression is a diff-in-diff relating the variables treatment-after, treatment and after.
