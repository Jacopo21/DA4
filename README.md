Final assignment for Data 4 ~ The code will be done in R (Menta Mora) and STATA (Jacopo Binati).

Our policy question: is civic participation influenced by freedom of choices (we could take in consideration a policy specific)? In the case study we will take in consideration confounders such as Freedom of opinion and expression, freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy. Moreover we would like to see how, and if, Covid-19 influenced and changed the trend of countries over the years. 

We will use the Database from WPJ on the quality of democracy over 140 countries worldwide for a time period that goes from 2012 until 2022. 
N = 140 / T = 10

Civil society is essential in upholding democracy, social justice, and the rule of law, both in Europe and worldwide. The European Union (EU) recognizes the significance of creating an environment that is supportive of civil society, where fundamental freedoms such as the freedom of association, peaceful assembly, and expression are safeguarded. These rights are protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU and various national constitutions. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on people's lives and welfare, which must be addressed by prioritizing the health situation and strengthening health systems. Nonetheless, it is crucial not to overlook the pandemic's effects on fundamental rights and the rule of law, which have been subject to substantial limitations. What we decided to investigate is how to balance the need to address the COVID-19 pandemic's health-related challenges with protecting fundamental rights and the rule of law, particularly those related to civil society and its participation and freedom of expression or choice.
